SYNOPSIS
        use Net::MPRPC::Client;
    
        my $client = Net::MPRPC::Client->new(
            host => '127.0.0.1',
            port => 4423,
        );

        my $client = Net::MPRPC::Client->new(
            host => 'unix/',
            port => '/tmp/mprpc.sock',
        );
    
        # call method "echo" with argument "foo bar"

DESCRIPTION
    Stub documentation for this module was created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.
    It looks like the author of the extension was negligent enough to leave
    the stub unedited.

    Blah blah blah.

METHODS
  new(%parameters)
        my $client = Net::MPRPC::Client->new(
            host => '127.0.0.1',
            port => 4423,
        );
    
        # or unix socket:
        my $client = Net::MPRPC::Client->new(
            host => 'unix/',
            port => '/tmp/mprpc.sock',
        );

    Create and return client object. Available parameters are:

    *   host => 'Str' (Required)

        MessagePack-RPC server's hostname to connect. If you want to use
        unix domain socket, this parameter should be "unix/".

    *   port => 'Int | Str' (Required)

        MessagePack-RPC server's port or UNIX socket path to connect.

    *   timeout => 'Int'

  call($method, $parameter)
        my $res = $client->call( echo => "foo bar" )
            or die $client->error;

    Call RPC method and return result.

    get error message by "error" method. When something other error (network
    error or etc) occured, this method throw exception.
